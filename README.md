## Project Goals


### First Time User Goals

When the user initially enters the site they are greeted with an clearly labelled navigation menu  to all pages. This is followed by a welcoming hero image with text overlay that includes the slogan that explains the name and objective if site.

There is then a call to action button to "Startâ€¦".  
At this point the user can click the call to action button or continue scrolling down, both options will take the user to information the exercises that they will be able to get information from the site.

The user will find three cards that each link to the exercise section it reflects.
This is designed to help the user have easy access to the exercise content.

The site has been designed to have styling and usage ease and this is represented through
The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

The user has access to a call to action button at the bottom of the pages barring the home page, where it located below the hero image.
This helps the user move freely throughout the site and not feel restrained to just that page.

When a user complete the user form on the contact page they will be returned to the home page.

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

## Design

### Typography

Exo | Lato | Oswald

The fonts that were used throughout the site are 'Exo', 'Lato' and 'Oswald'.  

Exo was used for heading and sub headings as it has a bold standout style that looks digital but welcoming to reflect the digital workout tool.
'Lato' was used for buttons and call to action and menu for its ease of readability.
Oswald was used for the body of text.

These fonts default to serif.

### Colour Scheme

 Colours:

    CSS HEX
    --black: #000000;
    --white: #ffffff;
    --rich-black-fogra: #000814;
    --prussian-blue: #003566
    --star-command-blue: #0077b6ff;
    --mikado-yellow: #ffc300;
    --oxford-blue":#001d3d;

![Colour scheme](docs/features/color-palette.png)

I used a simple black and white base to the site with vibrant yellow  and blue accents to match the brand theme.
These colours contrast very well for users who may struggle colour differentiation.
The colours also allow for s dark mode filter to easily changed the colours the user.

The exercise cards are colours based on their category, using red for burn, yellow for build snd blue for stretch.
