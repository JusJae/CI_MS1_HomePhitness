# **Milestone Project 1**

> Website for a home workouts.

I have been asked to design a static website with at least 3 pages and with the use of a CSS library.

I have designed a website for an online gym, where they deliver remote workout group sessions through video sessions and home workouts.

## User Experience

### Strategy

### User stories

 A person who is interested in getting in shape at home, but does not know what type of workout they would like to do. They would come to this website to find a workout to do at home and be able to get in contact with a personal trainer to book in the next remote workout session.
