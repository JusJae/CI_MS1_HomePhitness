## User Experience

## Project Goals

## User stories

 A person who is interested in getting in shape at home, but does not know what type of workout they would like to do. They would come to this website to find a workout to do at home and be able to get in contact with a personal trainer to book in the next remote workout session.

 ### First Time Visitor Goals

As a first time visitor to the site, I would like then to understand what we do and offer within the first few seconds of entering the site and easily be able to find out any further information and services offered.

When the user initially enters the site they are greeted with an clearly labelled navigation menu  to all pages. This is followed by a welcoming hero image with text overlay that includes the slogan that explains the name and objective if site. 

There is then a call to action button to "Startâ€¦".  
At this point the user can click the call to action button or continue scrolling down, both options will take the user to information the exercises that they will be able to get information from the site.

The user will find three cards that each link to the exercise section it reflects.
This is designed to help the user have easy access to the exercise content.

The site has been designed to have styling and usage ease and this is represented through 
The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content and they will be able to access the menu on every page.

The user has access to a call to action button at the bottom of the pages barring the home page, where it located below the hero image. 
This helps the user move freely throughout the site and not feel restrained to just that page.

When a user complete the user form on the contact page they will be returned to the home page.

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

A first time user will want to find out what services are on offer as quickly as possible and this is shown through the three cards at the bottom of the home page, taking the user to the allocated exercises for that category.

As first time user may also want to find out  about the company's social networking sites in order to do further research on the company to determine legitimacy and following, in addition to the desire to want to become part of the community. They will find the link within the footer located at the bottom of every page.

A new visitor interested in finding out more by reading the 'About Us' page will find a call to action  button at the bottom that will take them to the contact form page.

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

## Design

### Typography

Exo | Lato | Oswald

The fonts that were used throughout the site are 'Exo', 'Lato' and 'Oswald'.  

Exo was used for heading and sub headings as it has a bold standout style that looks digital but welcoming to reflect the digital workout tool.
Lato was used for buttons and call to action and menu for its ease of readability.
Oswald was used for the body of text.

These fonts default to serif.


### Colour Scheme
 Colours -
    CSS HEX
    --black: #000000;

    --mikado-yellow: #ffc300;

![Colour scheme](docs/features/color-palette.png)

I used a simple black and white base to the site with vibrant yellow  and blue accents to match the brand theme.
These colours contrast very well for users who may struggle colour differentiation.
The colours also allow for s dark mode filter to easily changed the colours the user.

The exercise cards are colours based on their category, using red for burn, yellow for build snd blue for stretch.
